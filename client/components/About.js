            I am a Los Angeles based Front-End Software Engineer with over 10
            years of development experience. The latter comes from working on
            enterprise websites which actively receive more than 2 million
            unique visitors a day. My duties include development of new features
            and components, active maintenance, code refactoring, as well as
            unit testing.

            If I am not writing code, you will probably find me walking my
            üêïnamed Rex through Griffith Park or surfing in Redondo Beach. I
            have recently started listening to tech talks at breweries - what
            could be more enjoyable than learning new technologies while having
            a beer?

            Below is a small sample of my work. All examples were taken from PSD
            to code. Technology used include React/Redux, HTML, CSS, PHP, and
            Magento.
